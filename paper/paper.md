# Summary

The Edmonds model [@edmonds2017global] divides food consumption into two categories, staples, which represent basic foodstuffs, and non-staples, which represent higher-quality foods. Demand for staples increases at low income, but eventually peaks and begins to decline with higher income. Demand for non-staples increases with income over all income ranges; however, total (staple + non-staple) demand saturates asymptotically at high income.

This is an example of a different use where we say @edmonds2017global did stuff.
