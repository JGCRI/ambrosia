\title{Recommended parameter limits for the model.}
\format{
An object of class \code{matrix} with 2 rows and 11 columns.
}
\usage{
plohi
}
\description{
Model parameters outside of these ranges are likely to produce models that
are numerically ill-behaved.  The first row of the matrix has recommended
minimum values; the second has recommended maximum values.
}
\details{
In other functions we talk about the "10-parameter" and "11-parameter" versions
of the model.  The 10-parameter version was used in early tests and is now
deprecated; therefore, these recommendations apply only to the 11-parameter
version.
