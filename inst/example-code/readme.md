# Running the GCAM food demand model from C++

This code shows how we used to use RInside to run the GCAM food demand
model from a C++ program.  At one time this was how we used our C++
Markov Chain Monte Carlo code with the model, but these days we've
switched over to R-native MCMC packages. If someone really wants to run the model from C++, it
should be easy to rework this example to run with the new
version.
